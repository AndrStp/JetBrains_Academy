<h1>Project: Password Hacker</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. 
In this project you’ll wear the hat of a real hacker. You must connect to a secret server without knowing the password. 
Your task is to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.

<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
You will learn how hacking works. You will work with iterators and generators, and you’ll learn a little something about 
the itertools module – one of the most powerful features of Python. 
You will practice developing a client app and connecting to a server using the socket module. 
The project will also get you acquainted with JSON and the time module.

<h2>This project is a part of the following tracks</h2>

<h2>What you’ll do and what you’ll learn</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Stage 1/5: Establishing a connection
    <p>For starters, let’s pretend the admin's website isn't protected at all. 
    Learn how to connect to the server and receive data from it to access private information.</p></li>
  <li>Stage 2/5: Simple brute force
    <p>OK, the admin has pumped up the server and it is now password-protected. 
    But the password is probably short. 
    Let's hack it by applying brute force (and no, that does not mean taking a jackhammer to the physical server!).</p></li>
  <li>Stage 3/5: Smarter, dictionary-based brute force
    <p>The admin has picked up on our attempts to access the server, so now it is protected with a more complex password. 
    Maybe the password is long but not unique? Let's hack it using a dictionary of the most common passwords!</p></li>
  <li>Stage 4/5: Catching exception
    <p>The admin is really taking the case seriously. 
    Now it is necessary to specify a valid login and password, and the password cannot be cracked by brute force. 
    And yet, there is a vulnerability in the system that you can exploit to identify the admin's login and password.</p></li>
  <li>Stage 5/5: Time-based vulnerability
    <p>The admin has reacted quickly and made a patch that removes the vulnerability. 
    It's time to look for another one. Poor admin…</p></li>
</ul>
