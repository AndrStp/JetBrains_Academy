My implementations of projects from Python for Beginners and Python Developer Tracks

<a href=https://hyperskill.org/tracks/6><h1>Python for Beginners</h1></a>

<b>Description:</b>

Completing projects will help you approach a complex problem by breaking it down into smaller manageable pieces. And learning to work in a development environment (IDE) will teach how to fix your code like a pro.

<b>Description:</b>

This track will guide you on your path of mastering Python, one of the much-in-demand languages in today's environment. Known for its straightforward syntax, Python is easy to learn and use, which gained this language popularity and makes its community grow every day. Most commonly, Python is used in data science, web development, and task automation.
What you'll learn and do:

Throughout the learning process, you will choose projects that correspond to your interests and your level, acquiring new information from theoretical references. Starting from simpler projects like programming a Simple Chatty Bot, you will move on to more challenging ones like implementing a web-browser, hack passwords or create your own website. If you feel confident in Python basics already, you can dive into Data Science, focus on web development with the Django framework, or continue with more advanced Python topics. 

<b>While progressing through different projects of this track you will have a chance to:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Get to know the Python syntax and its basic rules</li>
  <li>Learn to work in IDE, a special environment to write your code in</li>
  <li>Process data from different sources (files, databases, web-pages)</li>
  <li>Use standard and third-party libraries</li>
  <li>Apply the principles of object-oriented programming widely used in commercial development</li>
  <li>Work with Django to develop web applications</li>
  <li>Understand Machine learning and implement its algorithms</li>
  <li>Keep track of the functionality of your code by writing automatic tests</li>
  <li>Control different stages of the program development with the help of git</li>
  <li>Keep it errorless using bug trackers and logging</li>
  <li>Document your code and share it with other programmers on GitHub</li>
</ul>
