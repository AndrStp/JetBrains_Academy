<h1>Project: Tetris</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Tetris is one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time. You know the rules. Move and rotate blocks of various shapes to fill the empty space on the screen. Fill horizontal rows with the blocks to continue the gameplay. The game is over when there is no free space on the screen.</p>

<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>Use Object Oriented Programming to break down a complex problem into steps for easier implementation. Get familiar with algorithmic thinking, game design, and matrix manipulation. Learn how to limit your game board, store the blocks on the board, and make horizontal rows disappear. At the end of the project, you will have your own Tetris game!</p>

<h2>This project is a part of the following track</h2>

<h2>What you’ll do and what you’ll learn</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Stage 1/4: Getting Started</b><p>Design seven unique pieces that can be rotated counterclockwise inside a 4x4 grid.</p></li>
  <li><b>Stage 2/4: I Like to Move It!</b><p>Design your Tetris board and start moving the pieces across the board.</p></li>
  <li><b>Stage 3/4: Let the Pieces Hit the Floor</b><p>Store the piece on the game board once it hits the floor.</p></li>
  <li><b>Stage 4/4: I Disappear</b><p>Make blocks static when they hit other blocks and clear a row when it is filled.</p></li>
</ul>
