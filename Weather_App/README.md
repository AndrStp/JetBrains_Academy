<h1>Project: Weather App</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
There are many reasons why it is important to know the weather. It helps people make important decisions about the day. The weather may influence many different things from clothes to wear during a cold day to whether it is safe to fly an airplane.

<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
Work with the Flask library to implement a web application that will allow you to keep an eye on the weather. You will use Flask-SQLAlchemy to connect a database to your web application and work with a weather service API to get the current weather from all over the world.
